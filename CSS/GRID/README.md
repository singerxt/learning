# CSS Grid

### What kind of problem grid is resolving ?

Early CSS layouts were a mix of floats and positioned elements (fixed, absolute, relative).
Before Flex and Grid it was very difficult to to create footer what is always on the
bottom off page. _(Google: Sticky footer problem)_ and much more ;-)

Is worth to say that GRID is free from all tricks what we had to use before
like _clearfix_ for layouts based on _floats_. Is anybody remember _clearfix_ ? ;-)

Grid is allowing you to position elements in easy way without using positioned
elements etc.

### Quotes from resoures
> Ten years ago now, when the real job of a front-end developer was that
oof a browser-bugs expert. <cite>Rachel Andrew</cite>


### Support
Grid is supported by all modern browsers expect IE11

### Notes
CSS Grid seems to be more powerfull then _flex_. I would like to investigate how it's works.
